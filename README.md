# Next.JS Frame Extraction Project
This is a simple web app designed to simply allow people to upload video files and get a zip file in return

# To-Do
This is my first time messing around with next.js/web apps in general so apologies for the lack of quality in the code :
- Allow arbitary FPS values (code is there but need to get frametime info from file uploaded)
- Thumbnail Preview (Code is there but was a bit borked when I tested it with long files)
